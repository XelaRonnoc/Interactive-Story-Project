# Interactive-Story-Project

## Justification

Gwydion is an Interactive story project built using Jquery that explores ideas of eusociality, consciousness and AI. Whilst heavily story based Gwydion allows the player to interact at key points within the narrative responding to situations in different ways and ultimately effecting the outcome of the story.

The choice to be so heavily focused on story as opposed to the interactive elements was in order to communicate a clear vision communicating the deeper story as I envisioned it whilst remaining within the alloted time frame. I toyed with the idea of a more significantly branching narrative (Branching earlier instead of at the end) however due to the time constraint of the task this would have resulted in a significantly shorter, narrower and less focused story that would have struggled to communicate anything of interest or import or provide any significant true narrative development. Instead dissolving into a web of short and uninteresting sub plots that served little greater whole. With more time it would have been possible to provide a complete and intriguing narrative built in that way. However, I decided it was unfortunately untenable in the allotted time.
